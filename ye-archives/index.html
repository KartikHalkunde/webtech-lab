                    Kanye West, now known as Ye, is a trailblazing American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and fashion designer. One of the most influential and successful musicians of his generation, Ye's career is defined by a constant evolution of sound and style, pushing the boundaries of hip-hop and popular music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the soulful, sped-up vocal samples of <em>The College Dropout</em> to the abrasive industrial sounds of <em>Yeezus</em> and the maximalist grandeur of <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>, he has consistently redefined what is possible in the studio. Beyond music, his impact on fashion through his Yeezy brand and his polarizing public persona have made him a permanent fixture in global cultural discourse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With 24 Grammy Awards and over 160 million records sold, his legacy as a creative powerhouse is undeniable, forever changing the landscape of art and industry.
